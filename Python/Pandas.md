## Pandas | Why?
  - Pandas allows to analyze big data efficiently, making it easy to derive insights from statistical theories. With Pandas, you can perform various operations like- **filtering, grouping, merging,** and **reshaping data,** making it easy to work with large datasets.
  - Pandas also offers the ability to **clean** and **transform** messy datasets, making them **readable** and **relevant**. This is important because often, datasets can have **missing values, inconsistent formatting**, or other types of errors. Pandas provides a range of tools to help address these issues, allowing you to focus on the data that is relevant to your analysis.
  
  Ultimately, **relevant data** is crucial in data science. We need to ensure that the data we're working with is **accurate, up-to-date,** and **appropriate** for our analysis for better business insights.
